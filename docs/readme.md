# Game of Life

### Overview

This project is our group's interpretation of John Conway's Game of Life, developed during our deepdive week. We chose to use the LÃ–VE 2D game engine for this project. While the core mechanics remain true to Conway's original ruleset, we added several features to enhance the experience, including sound effects, a toolbar with prefabs, speed controls, and a camera for navigating the infinite grid.
