# Game of Life

### Overview

This project is our group's remake of John Conway's Game of Life. We chose to use the love2d game engine for our project. The game works like John's Game of Life is supposed to work but we added some features like sound effects when placing or removing cells, a toolbar where you can select prefabs, speed control and even camera and zoom control to navigate the infinite grid.
