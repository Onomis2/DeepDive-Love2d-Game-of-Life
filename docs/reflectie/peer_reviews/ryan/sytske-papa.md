What did you think of the overall collaboration with sytske?

e.g. "I think she tried her best trying to keep up with us, she really didnt know alot about love2d or lua so it isnt really her fault, i did enjoy working with her."

I give [25] out of 100 points to sytske.

Extra feedback:

e.g. "She is little unfocused and distracted most of the times, and should've asked more help when she was stuck"
