What did you think of the overall collaboration with Sytske?

Sytske joined the group knowing that we were going to work in a language and with an engine she is unfamiliar with, but took the initiative to learn it from scrath. She actually did really well and was able to provide code for our project within a day or 2 of learning which I find very admirable.
